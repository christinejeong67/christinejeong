                <strong>Motivation</strong><br><br>
                The motivation for designing Serene Space stemmed from the need to address the overwhelming stress and unhealthy coping mechanisms many students reported in a user survey. Responses such as "avoiding it," "not really sure," and "lying down eating sweets" highlighted a gap in healthy stress management strategies. Recognizing that students lacked access to consistent guidance and engaging, accessible meditation tools, the project was driven by the desire to create a platform that is both user-friendly and supportive of personal well-being.

                <strong>Research</strong><br><br>
                Stress management is a significant challenge for students, with many resorting to ineffective and inconsistent coping mechanisms. According to a user experience survey conducted in September 2024, 15 out of 20 college students commonly responded to the question, "What are your methods of managing stress at school?" with answers like "avoiding it," "not really sure," and "lying down on bed and eating sweets." Although these students recognized that their strategies were not effective, they struggled to develop healthier habits.<br><br>
                Additionally, many respondents indicated a lack of experience with meditation apps or websites. Those who had used such platforms found them difficult to navigate, citing the need for better guidance for beginners and expressing frustration with features and content locked behind paywalls. This feedback emphasized the need for a user-friendly interface, personalized guidance, and accessible content.<br><br>
                The core problems are:<br><br>
                <strong>1. Inconsistent stress management</strong><br>
                Many students struggle with managing stress consistently and effectively. They often rely on unstructured, unhealthy coping mechanisms due to a lack of engaging and personalized meditation tools.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Lack of guidance for beginners</strong><br>
                Students new to meditation often feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start, leading to difficulty in sustaining a meditation routine.

                <strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
                <strong>1. Personalized Playlists and Mood-Based Recommendations</strong><br>
                By allowing users to create personalized playlists and explore mood-based meditation tracks, Serene Space addresses the need for a customizable, engaging user experience that encourages consistent use.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Guided Daily Meditation Schedule</strong><br>
                The "Daily Meditation Schedule" provides structured, guided sessions based on individual preferences and goals set during registration, making it easier for beginners to develop meditation routines.<br><br>
                <strong>3. Integrated Diary with Soundtracks</strong><br>
                The "My Diary" feature lets users write entries while embedding specific meditation tracks or sounds, creating an immersive reflective experience. Revisiting entries with accompanying sound enhances mindfulness and helps users deepen their meditation practice.
